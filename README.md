# Ancient Evil
Ancient Evil is a isometric role-playing game. I wanted to combine Gothic atmosphere with Diablo gameplay. 

I created this project based on the course https://www.udemy.com/course/unityrpg/
So far i have learnd a lot about: 
* Saving system 
* Connections betweens scenes
* Inventory systems
* Dialogue systems
* Editor tools

After finishing the course I implemented new features and I was polishing my game to make memorable experience for all players

You can see the final result here:
