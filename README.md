# RPG-Project
RPG-Project will be a isometric role-playing game. I want to combine Gothic atmosphere with Diablo gameplay. 

I am creating this project based on the course https://www.udemy.com/course/unityrpg/
So far i have learnd a lot about: 
* Saving system 
* Connections betweens scenes

After finishing this course I am going to polish my game and add plenty of my own features in order to create interesting and memorable experience.
